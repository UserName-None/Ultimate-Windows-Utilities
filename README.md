# This is a set of windows utilities that I found and I think that they are COMPLETELY essential. 

DISCLAIMER: I did not developed any of these utilities, so I will not be responsible for any issues or harm they cause.

These tools are COMPLETELY free, although SOME of them COULD ask for donations or have a  premium version.

## 1. Chris Titus Techs's Windows Utility: 

Developed by ChrisTitus, this a Windows PowerShell command-line tool that allows you to tweak windows, install features, change update settings and install apps. In my opinion, you should run this right after having a fresh install of Windows. Make sure you have internet and just run this command in PowerShell as Administrator: 

```
iwr -useb https://christitus.com/win | iex
```

But just make sure that you restart your system to apply the changes.

## 2. 7-zip:

This is one of the most useful tools in Windows. It can extract and compress almost all types of archives, from RAR to ISO. Quick Link for downloading if you use 64-bit x64 Windows system: https://www.7-zip.org/a/7z2301-x64.exe. But if you use other operating systems: https://www.7-zip.org/download.html.

## 3. LockHunter:

This is a file app. It allows you to unlock any files that may be used by some other processes and force delete them. Sometimes, though it can't delete a few files because of permission issues. In that case, you can choose to add the file or folder to be deleted on the next system reboot. And it also adds a file explorer context menu. Download the LockHunter installer: https://lockhunter.com/assets/exe/lockhuntersetup_3-4-3.exe. Or, go to their website to download the portable version: https://lockhunter.com/download.htm.

## 4. WPD Privacy dashboard for Windows: 

This is also a Windows tweaker, but focused on tweaking Windows privacy settings. It change telemetry settings, privacy, firewall, Windows updates, IP, and more! Download it now: https://wpd.app/get/latest.zip. Their website: https://wpd.app.

## 5. Razer Cortex:

This is a quite famous application. It boosts your computer. But I think that it is better at cleaning the computer junk files. So, PROTIP: Do not use Razer Cortex for boosting your computer, as it uses even more resources than what it frees. Use it to clean junk. Don't allow it to start at system startup or running at the background.

## 6. Caffeine:

This is a very small Windows utility that prevents your computer from falling asleep. When you open it, it will show a coffee icon at the system tray. Right click the icon for options, such as "Enable" or "Disable". It is available for Windows, Linux and MacOS. Direct download link for Windows: https://zhornsoftware.co.uk/caffeine/caffeine.zip. Download for mac: https://intelliscapesolutions.com/apps/caffeine. For Linux users, try to find it in the GNOME Software app.

## 7. Precise Calculator:

This is an open source awesome app that calculates math to a specified precision. It is REALLY good. But avaliable on Windows only. Download on SourceForge: https://sourceforge.net/projects/preccalc/files/preccalc-64bit.zip/download. I personally use it as my main calculator!

## 8. Krita:

No matter if you are an image editor, artist or just want to view and slightly edit some images, Krita is perfect. It is free, open source, and very well trusted. But somehow it is not free at Microsoft Store, so just download it from https://download.kde.org/stable/krita/5.1.5/krita-x64-5.1.5-setup.exe. But there is a little problem with it: If you don't have a gaming PC, Krita may feel a bit laggy or take some time to open.

## 9. Brave:

Come on! You need some refresh. Don't use Google Chrome all the time, it gets boring! I invite you to try... Brave Browser! It has a built-in adblocker that automatically speeds up your browsing! It also has a built-in crypto wallet and a rewards system that helps support content creators. Or, you can also earn crypto by browsing! Brave also takes great care of your privacy, so it has 2 types of incognito windows: Incognito and Incognito with Tor! If you don't know what Tor is, it is a web browser that is completely anonymous. Brave is available for Windows Mac and Linux: https://brave.com/download/.

## 10. Python:

Even if you don't want to do some programming, python can really automate Windows for you! It has a really simple syntax almost equal to English, and it's super easy to install, learn and use! It is very powerful, and also used for making AI. Download for Windows 64-bit x64: https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.11.5/python-3.11.5-amd64.exe. Other Downloads for the currently latest version (3.11.5): https://www.python.org/downloads/.

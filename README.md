This is a set of windows utilities that I found and I think that they are COMPLETELY essential. 

DISCLAIMER: I did not developed any of these utilities, so I will not be responsible for any issues or harm they cause.

1. Chris Titus Techs's Windows Utility: Developed by ChrisTitus, this a Windows PowerShell command-line tool that allows you to tweak windows, install features, change update settings and install apps. In my opinion, you should run this right after having a fresh install of Windows. Make sure you have internet and just run this command in PowerShell as Administrator: 'iwr -useb https://christitus.com/win | iex'
